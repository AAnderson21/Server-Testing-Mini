# Server-Testing-Mini

## A follow along practice for teaching TDD

## The purpose of this guided demo is to get you to set up your environment for building out your CRUD API with Documentation, tests and of course, your endpoints.

---

## Step 1.

* Create an empty directory and name it whatever you'd like.
* Initialize your project with an `npm init` command (This will create a `package.json` file that you can run `npm` commands to in order to save your `node_modules`).
* The packages that we need for this project are:
  * express
  * body-parser
  * mongoose
  * mocha
  * chai-http
  * morgan
  * sinon

## Step 2.

* Create the following files in your project.

  * server.js
  * app.js
  * documentation.md
  * .gitignore
  * routes.test.js
  * models.test.js
